# Lab Report 3 - Week 5
## Examining `grep`
For this week's lab we are tasked with researching commands. I am choosing to research more about the `grep` command. I will be examing the following command-line options:

* `-c`, `--count`
* `--colour=[when]`, `--colour=[when]`
* `-v`, `--invert-match`

## `-c`, `--count`
