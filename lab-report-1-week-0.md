In this tutorial you will learn how I learned to log onto the UCSD remote super computers and how to complete Lab 1 for Cse 15L
## Installing VS Code
We need software in order to write software. For this tutorial we will be using an IDE called Visual Studio Code so make sure to have it installed.

> Steps to install:
> 1. Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (I already had it installed to my system)
> 2. Since I run MacOs I downloaded the mac downloader to get vscode set up
> 3. Now I have vs code yay!

Here is a picture of what my vs code looks like.

## Remotely Connecting
Here I will show you how I connected to the super computers. I sort of struggled with this step because I was not able to change my password but I finally was able to do it and here is how.

1. The first step is I changed my password. 

> I struggled with this for no reason. If I had followed the instructions given I would have saved a lot of time. Use this link provided by the CSE15L staff: [How to reset you're password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)

2. Opened up a terminal on vscode
3. Use `ssh` command to connect
> `ssh cs15lfa22bo@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
4. Entered my password. (the password does not demonstrate input, its almost like it is invisible) Then I clicked enter
5. Sweet log in sucessful
